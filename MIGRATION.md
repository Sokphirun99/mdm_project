# Admin Panel Migration

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The MDM admin panel has been successfully migrated from Flutter to React.js.

### What Changed
- **Frontend**: Flutter Web → React.js with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Flutter Material → Material-UI (MUI)
- **Build Tool**: Flutter → Vite
- **State Management**: Flutter Provider → React Context + TanStack Query
- **Routing**: Flutter GoRouter → React Router v6

### Docker Configuration
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to build from `react-admin-panel` instead of `flutter-admin-panel`
- React app is served via nginx on port 8080
- API base URL is properly configured for containerized deployment

### Backup
- Original Flutter admin panel backed up to `flutter-admin-panel.backup/`
- All Flutter code preserved for reference

### Current Features
✅ Authentication (Login/Logout)

✅ API integration with backend
✅ Dockerized deployment

### Next Steps
- Implement remaining features from Flutter version:

- Default credentials: admin@example.com / admin1234
- Backend API: http://localhost:3000
- Database: PostgreSQL on port 5435

### Migration Benefits
- Modern React ecosystem
- Better TypeScript integration
- Faster development with Vite
